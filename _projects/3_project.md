## Overview

Moving beyond complex, high-dimensional transcriptomic signatures, this project focuses on developing **simple, reproducible biomarker frameworks** applicable in clinical decision-making for metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).

## Objectives

1. Develop low-dimensional stratification models for immunotherapy response prediction
2. Guide selection between dual immune checkpoint blockade (IO/IO) and IO-TKI combinations
3. Translate molecular phenotypes into pragmatic clinical tools

## Project 1: Dual HERV-Based Stratification System

    </div>
</div>

### Approach

- Developed a simple stratification model based on **two genomic features** derived from RNA-seq data
- Leveraged updated clinical follow-up from the BIONIKK trial
- Validated in external prospective cohorts

### Key Results

- Reproducibly separated patients into groups with **distinct clinical outcomes** following immunotherapy
- **Improved predictive performance** compared with conventional transcriptomic signatures
- **Additive value** when combined with epigenetic DNA methylation markers
- Pragmatic framework suitable for clinical implementation

### Clinical Utility

This low-dimensional model provides:

- Simple, cost-effective biomarker assessment
- Clear treatment stratification guidance
- Integration with existing molecular profiling

## Project 2: Angiogenic Subtypes and IO/IO Selection

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/angiogenic_subtypes.jpg" title="Angiogenic response" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### Clinical Question

**How to select between dual immune checkpoint blockade (IO/IO) and IO-TKI combinations?**

### Study Design

- Used molecular subtypes defined within the BIONIKK trial
- Compared outcomes between ipilimumab-nivolumab and IO-TKI regimens
- Stratified by tumor molecular phenotypes

### Major Findings

**Angiogenic tumor phenotypes**:

- Derived **significantly greater benefit** from ipilimumab-nivolumab
- Higher objective response rates
- **Exclusive complete responses**
- Longer progression-free survival

**Non-angiogenic tumors** (T-effector, cell-cycle programs):

- Attenuated advantage from dual checkpoint blockade
- Similar outcomes with IO-TKI combinations

**Critical insight**: IO-TKI combinations did **not** confer additional benefit in angiogenic tumors

### Clinical Implications

These findings challenge conventional treatment paradigms and suggest:

- Angiogenic phenotype as a **positive predictive biomarker** for IO/IO
- Potential to avoid unnecessary TKI-related toxicity
- Refined patient selection for combination strategies

## Integrated Framework

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">

    </div>
</div>

The combination of these approaches provides a **multi-layered stratification strategy**:

1. **Genomic features** (HERV-based model) - rapid screening
2. **Epigenetic markers** (iMES, TED) - mechanistic depth
3. **Molecular subtypes** (angiogenic vs. non-angiogenic) - treatment selection

## Impact

This work represents a transition from:

- **Descriptive molecular profiling** → **Biomarker-informed clinical decision-making**
- **Complex signatures** → **Simple, robust molecular readouts**
- **Retrospective analysis** → **Prospective trial-based validation**

## Future Applications

- Integration into clinical trial design
- Development of companion diagnostics
- Real-world implementation in precision oncology programs
- Extension to other cancer types
