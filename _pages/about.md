## About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** in the [Molecular and Translational Oncology](https://www.igbmc.fr/) team at the **Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC)** in Illkirch, France, working under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel Malouf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=...).

My research focuses on leveraging **computational approaches** and **multi-omics integration** to understand cancer heterogeneity, predict treatment responses, and identify novel therapeutic targets. I am particularly interested in:

- **Cancer subtyping** using multi-omics data integration
- **Immunotherapy biomarkers** in renal cell carcinoma
- **Tumor microenvironment** characterization
- **Epigenetic regulation** of treatment resistance

## Research Highlights

### Multi-Omics Cancer Subtyping

I developed **[MOVICS](https://github.com/xlucpu/MOVICS)**, an R package for multi-omics integration and visualization in cancer subtyping. With **197 citations** and **144 GitHub stars**, MOVICS has become a widely-used tool in the cancer genomics community. The companion interactive platform **MOVICShiny** enables researchers to perform analyses without programming expertise.

### Immunotherapy Resistance in Kidney Cancer

My work on the **BIONIKK clinical trial** (NCT02960906) has identified epigenetic determinants of immunotherapy response in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Key discoveries include:

- The **Tumor Enhancer Demethylation (TED)** phenotype associated with immune dysfunction
- The **Epigenetic Silencing Index (iMES)** predictive of primary resistance to immunotherapy
- **Angiogenic subtypes** that show enhanced response to combination immunotherapy

These findings, published in *Cell Reports Medicine*, *Clinical Cancer Research*, and *JITC*, provide actionable biomarkers for precision oncology.

### Rare and Pediatric Tumors

I have contributed to comprehensive molecular characterization of rare tumors including:
- **Upper tract urothelial carcinomas** (published in *Genome Biology*)
- **Anaplastic Wilms tumors** (published in *Nature Communications*)
- **Translocation renal cell carcinomas** (Rally Foundation funded)
