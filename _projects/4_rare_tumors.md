### Background

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a **rare and understudied** malignancy arising in the renal pelvis or ureter, with distinct biology from bladder cancer.

### Research Objectives

- Comprehensive molecular characterization using multi-omics integration
- Identification of clinically relevant molecular subtypes
- Discovery of novel tumor suppressive programs

### Approach

Integrative analysis of:

- RNA sequencing
- Whole-exome sequencing
- DNA methylation profiling

### Key Discoveries

**Molecular subtypes**:

- Identified distinct molecular and epigenetic subtypes
- Associated with **muscle invasiveness** and **patient outcome**
- Novel tumor suppressive programs discovered

**Clinical relevance**:

- Demonstrated how genomic and epigenomic alterations converge to shape aggressive tumor phenotypes
- Provided clinically meaningful disease stratification
- Potential biomarkers for treatment selection

**Publication**: Su, Lu et al., _Genome Biology_ (2021)

### Impact

- First comprehensive multi-omics characterization of UTUC
- Foundation for future biomarker development
- Insights into mechanisms of muscle invasion

    </div>
</div>

### Background

Diffuse anaplastic Wilms tumor (AWT) is a **rare and aggressive pediatric kidney cancer** with poor prognosis and limited treatment options.

### Research Focus

Understanding the interplay between **tumor-intrinsic alterations** and the **tumor microenvironment (TME)**.

### Integrative Analysis

Combined approaches:

- Whole-exome sequencing
- RNA sequencing
- Immune profiling
- Multi-omics integration

### Major Findings

**TME heterogeneity**:

- Identified distinct TME phenotypes associated with prognosis
- Described an **immune-depleted ("desert-like") subtype**

**Molecular mechanisms**:

- Characterized by **TP53 alterations**
- Specific oncogenic programs activated
- Revealed **epigenetic vulnerabilities** that could be therapeutically exploited

**Conceptual framework**:

- Established mechanistic link between:
  - Epigenetic regulation
  - Immune exclusion
  - Therapeutic sensitivity

**Publication**: Su, Lu et al., _Nature Communications_ (2023)

### Translational Significance

- Potential therapeutic targets identified
- Framework for understanding immune evasion in pediatric cancers
- Bridge toward adult renal oncology research

### Collaboration

This work established collaboration with **Dr. Sehrish Khan Bazai** in functional genomics, enriching understanding of epigenetic regulation in cancer.
